# WordleWordBot
This was a joke that one of my friends dared me to do, and I randomly spent like 5 hours to make this!
## How to use this!
  1. Makr sure you have go 1.17+ installed on the device you're gonna build this on!
  2. Download the repository and open a CMD/Terminal in the directory of the folder.
  3. Add your bot login information to the main file, through lines 94-97! 
  4. To download all the dependencies that are required download `go mod download`
  5. After that, if you're on Windows run `go build`, otherwise run `./build.sh`.
  6. Once that finishes you're done, and you can run it by doing `./WordleWordOfTheDayTwitterBot`
